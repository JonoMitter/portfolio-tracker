# Portfolio Tracker

## Overview
A web-based app that allows users to store and view all their stock holdings from one central dashboard.

Users can easily add their stock data consisting of each stock's Code, Company Name, number of Units and their average Purchase Price.

The project uses React.JS with TypeScript to display frontend content to the user. 
The client accesses various .NET(C#) backend APIs for user authentication and stock creation/modification. 
The backend retrieves User and Holding data from a SQLite database using .NET EntityFramework.

## Future Features:
- Cryptocurrency/Cash/Super holding options.
- Google/Facebook/Discord gogins.
- Pie charts showing holding distribution across asset class and industry.
- Line chart showing user wealth over time.
